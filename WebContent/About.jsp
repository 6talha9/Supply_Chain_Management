		<h4>
			Thank you for taking the time to get to know PCL, Pune's #1 custom
			computer builder. We emphasize customization over every aspect of
			each computer, offering personal consulting and support that is
			becoming quite rare in the industry. Our goal is to provide each
			client with the best possible computer for their needs and budget.<br>
			<br>Many of the computers we build cannot be bought in the shops
			as we concentrate on selling high performance computers for the home,
			office and especially for gamers and professional digital photo/video
			editors.<br> <br>We can build a computer to your exact
			specifications, meaning you are not paying for parts that you may not
			use. The computers that we create for you will be to industry
			standards and exactly tailored to your needs. We only use top quality
			components.<br> <br>With every computer purchased from us
			you will get low-cost telephone technical support, customer service
			second to none, and most of all, a new computer that you will want to
			show off to your friends and relatives.
		</h4>
		<h3>Our Philosophy:</h3>
		<h4>Our philosophy is simple: Build a high quality product, offer
			outstanding support, PCL Custom Computers was founded with the goal
			to break the trend of low quality, one-size-fits-all computers and to
			provide systems with superior performance and reliability. We have
			gone to great trouble to structure our business in such a way that
			our goals are, by necessity, the same as yours! Because we have a
			commitment to the complete support of your computer system, we save
			ourselves time and money by providing the computer system that is
			least likely to fail. It seems perfectly logical and straight-forward
			to us: We can't imagine why some companies would use low quality
			parts. It just doesn't make sense! Furthermore, we do not hire
			salesmen. We hire qualified technicians. The people you talk to
			before your purchase are qualified to build that same computer and
			give you support after your purchase. We have better things to do
			than hire a kid without computer experience to feed you canned
			answers. It all ties back to our philosophy that the best way to run
			a business is to focus on your product. Get rid of the hype, and
			focus on your goal -- quality computers!</h4>
